    <h3> The leardership mentality classes </h3>

    <p>On the first day of classes, we started with a topic called <b>"effectiveness."</b> I learned that being effective helps us achieve the results we want today and sets us up for even better results in the future. We then delved into the <b>roots of effectiveness</b>, which are rooted in our personality and character. We also briefly touched on the concept of the <b> maturity continuum</b>. We discussed how our <b>paradigm</b>, or our way of seeing the world, impacts our lives and influences our actions, leading to certain results. It was emphasized that there is an urgent need to change our paradigm.A quote by "Stephen Covey "stood out to me: <mark>"If you want to make minor changes in your life, work on your behavior. But if you want to make significant quantum breakthroughs, work on your paradigm." </mark>This resonated strongly with me and I believe it was a key takeaway from the class. Lastly, we explored the concept of <b>"principles govern"</b> and the importance of being honest with ourselves rather than pushing ourselves to do things beyond our capabilities.

    <p> We delved into the maturity continuum and began with the <b>independence class on habit one, known as the "attitude of l", focusing on the habit of being "proactive"</b>. <Mark>I learned that being reactive, the opposite of proactive</Mark>, hinders leadership qualities. We were encouraged to reflect on situations where we tend to react and identify the sources of these reactive tendencies. Practicing proactive language such as "I can", "I choose to", and "I will" over reactive language like "I can't", "I have to", and "It's impossible" creates a mindset aimed at personal growth.
        We also covered the concept of the <b>"circle of influence"</b>, which encourages a positive outlook by considering our choices and their results. This entails recognizing elements within our circle of influence (e.g., choices, mindset, self-discipline) and understanding what lies beyond our control (e.g., circumstances, other people's actions), also referred to as the <b>"circle of concern" </b>or reactive thinking. Focusing on aspects within our circle of influence leads to greater productivity, allowing us to pause and respond based on principles and desired outcomes.
        
        We were introduced to <b>"the last human freedom"</b>, which revolves around practicing self-awareness, imagination, conscience, and independent will to choose our responses. Emphasizing the development of patience, humility, and self-compassion, I began to adopt a proactive mindset and language, fostering effective thinking and resourcefulness</p>
        <p> We delved into habit two, <b>"begin with the end in mind."</b> We took the first step by identifying 4-5 influential people and their admirable qualities in my life and envisioning what I would want these individuals to say about me on my 80th birthday. I was given the task of crafting a personal mission statement based on these principles and committing to live by it. Moreover, I embraced the role of a <b>transition person </b>by actively breaking unhealthy patterns and adopting proactive behaviors. I learned to control my mindset and uphold a positive attitude in every circumstance. I also made a conscious decision to release past grievances, propel myself forward, and positively impact the growth and development of others..</p>
         <p> I reviewed and refined my personal mission statement regularly. I realized that it can be summed up as <mark>"live, laugh, love, learn." The object that best represented me was a candle because I enjoy bringing light and joy to others, even if it comes at the cost of my own happiness. I find fulfillment in doing good for others, even if I'm not appreciated as long as I've brought a smile to someone's face. </mark> 
            Next was habit three, which is <b>"first things first." </b>I learned to prioritize important but not urgent tasks using the <b>quadrant system</b>. I aimed to reduce things in <mark>quadrant 4 and 3, maximize things in quadrant 2, and give less time to quadrant 1 tasks as they tend to wear me out</mark>.<br>  <img src="/blog241/images/q system.png" alt="quadrant system"> I also applied the concept of <b>the big rocks first theory</b>, starting with the most important tasks before addressing smaller ones. I learned to <b>plan my week </b>before it began by finding a quiet place, prioritizing the most important tasks, and being disciplined in executing the plans. By reducing distractions, eliminating unimportant activities, focusing on top priorities, being assertive in pursuing goals, and working on improving relationships, I aimed to improve my performance and become more productive and efficient.</p>
