  <p>First, we started with <strong>elements for editing text</strong>. We covered the bold element "b", strong for emphasizing a strong message, italic style, emphasis, subscript, and superscript, among others. Then, we looked at HTML comments which allow you to leave a message on the page or document your code, but what is put in here is not displayed on the page.</p> 
    <p>Next, we delved into <b>HTML tables </b>and saw the tag "table>" and its structure, including elements such as the table heading, table rows, and table data. We also learned about common table editing options like aligning text, padding for spacing, and table grids.
        After that, we explored HTML lists, using "ol>" for an ordered list starting from one, and "ul" for unordered lists which use bullets. We also discussed CSS properties, like using "I" to make text italic.Moving on to HTML forms, we learned about the tag and the importance of including a label for an input like text, email, or name.
        </p> 
        <p>We then <strong>introduced CSS</strong>, which is used to enhance the appearance of HTML pages by changing background colors, font styles, and more. We discussed three types of CSS: external, internal, and inline. Internal CSS involves putting CSS in an element, external CSS involves creating a CSS style sheet and linking it to the page, while inline CSS involves putting the CSS in the tags.
            We explored selectors commonly used in external CSS, including element selectors, class selectors, and id selectors. We also covered CSS syntax, which includes the selector, property, and value, and discussed CSS features like colors and backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>Moving to<b> Git incloud </b>, we likened it to having a Google Drive for storing files. We discussed setting up a Git account, creating an online repository, linking it to a local git repository, and using "git push" to add the project from the local repository to the online one.</p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we discussed <strong> Boot strap</strong>, which is pre-written CSS that can be used instead of writing custom CSS every time. We talked about using <b>Bootstrap grid</b> by adding a link to your page to use it online or downloading the file, unzipping it, and adding it to the page. We also discussed the Bootstrap grid, which helps in layout allocation..
