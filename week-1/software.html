    <h3>WEB DESIGING</h3>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Firstly, we were introduced to the <b>internet and how it works</b>. The difference between the web and the internet is that the web is just for connecting the internet to distant devices. The internet can still be in place when the web is not, while the web can't exist without the internet. 
        We also learned about <b>HTML and HTTP </b> is for transporting data and HTML is for creating webpages. Additionally, we learned about the <b>URL</b>, which is the uniform resource locator that identifies the location of a specific resource on the internet. We also covered the <b>IP</b>, which is the internet protocol address that contains device location information and enables data sharing.
        We learned how to build <b>software</b>, which involves a group of people such as designers, business analysts, testing individuals, and back-end and front-end teams, etc.
        </p>
        <p>We have implemented <b>version control</b> to keep track of changes and updates for the project. We have also integrated <b>Visual Studio Code and Git </b>to manage our files. In the "workspace" folder, we have created a sub-folder named "intro-to-git" and opened it in Visual Studio Code. Additionally, we have set up Git within Visual Studio Code using the terminal. First, we checked if Git was installed by typing "git --version". Then, we configured Git with our name and email using the commands "git config --global user.name your_name" and "git config --global user.email your_email@gmail.com". After that, we initialized Git in the project by running "git init". To review the status of changes, we used the command "git status". To stage all changes, we used "git add .", and lastly, we committed our changes to Git using the command "git commit -m "message””.</p>
        <p>We were introduced to <b>HTML</b>, which is a standard markup language for web pages. We learned about the declaration, which is the document type for HTML, like this: <!DOCTYPE HTML>. 
            We also discussed HTML elements used for containing information about the HTML page, such as <h> for headings, <body> for the body, and p for paragraphs. Each element consists of a start tag, content, and end tag. 
            We examined the structure of an HTML page and learned about HTML links, identified by the <a> tag. We discussed how to insert a link and include an image or text that users can click on to be directed to the link, for example, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">school</a>. 
            Lastly, we covered images in HTML, using the <img> tag, which must have a source and an alternative text. The alternative text serves as a backup if the image source fails to load, like this: img src="jona.jpg" alt="jona
